            <p>Memory paging is a memory management technique that divides both virtual and phyisical memory address space into fixed size units called <strong>pages</strong>.</p>

            <p>It is the OS responsibility to manage these pages and map virtual pages to physical frames via a <strong>page table</strong> for each process. This feature isolates processes, avoiding races for address spaces</p>
            
            <p>Paging is enabled in most (if not all) modern operating systems. Among the many features it provides, a known historical one is called <a href="swap.html">swapping</a>, which consists of moving full processes between physical memory and disk to free up RAM.</p>

            <p>Fun fact: It is an analogy to the pages of a book, where the smallest unit that can be indexed is a page.</p>
