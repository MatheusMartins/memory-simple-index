            <h1>Allocation</h1>

            <p>Memory allocation is the process of dedicating a deliberate amount of space to a specific purpose or task within a program.</p>
            
            <p>Static allocated memory can be referred to as <strong>static</strong>, <strong>fixed</strong>, <strong>compile-time</strong> or <a href="./stack.html"><strong>stack</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>Dynamic allocated memory can be referred to as <strong>dynamic</strong>, <strong>run-time</strong> or <a href="./heap.html"><strong>heap</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>Static allocation is always safer, because the size and lifetime of the memory is known at compile time, reducing the risk of errors such as memory leaks, vulnerabilities or data corruption (e.g. <a href="./buffer-overflow.html">buffer overflows</a>).</p>
