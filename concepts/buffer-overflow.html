            <h1>Buffer Overflow</h1>

            <p>A buffer overflow is a type exception or error, where a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.</p>
            <p>Buffer overflows can lead not only to crashes and data corruption, but also to exploitation by attackers to execute arbitrary code or retrieve sensitive information. Proper bounds checking and safe programming practices are essential to prevent buffer overflows.</p>
