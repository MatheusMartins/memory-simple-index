            <h1>Garbage Collector</h1>

            <p>A garbage collector is a feature for automating memory management on behalf of the programmer, by attempting to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.</p>
            <p>Some programming languages offer garbage collection out of the box (Golang, Java & JavaScript, C#, Python). Other languages require manual memory management (C, C++, Zig). In these cases, it is also possible to develop your own garbage collector.</p>
