            <h1>Swap / swapping</h1>

            <p>Swapping is a memory management technique that involves moving entire processes between physical memory and disk to free up RAM.</p>

            <p>This is not synonymous with <a href="pages.html">paging</a>, because swapping moves entire processes rather than individual pages, but it relies on paging to function. Another difference is that swapping generally needs to be configured or enabled by the user instead of being enabled by default.</p>
