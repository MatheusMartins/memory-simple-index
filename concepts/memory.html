            <h1>Memory</h1>

            <p>Memory in computing refers to the storage of data or programs, temporarily or permanently. It is a fundamental concept that allows a computer to function by holding the information it needs to operate.</p>

            <p>Memory can be classified into two main types: volatile and non-volatile. Volatile memory requires power to maintain the stored information, while non-volatile memory, such as hard drives and SSDs, retains data even when the power is turned off. Generally, the term "memory" refers to volatile memory, while non-volatile memory is often referred to as "storage".</p>

            <p>The most common type of memory is RAM (Random Access Memory) which is a type of volatile memory used for temporary data storage while a computer is active - which is, by the way, the main focus of this website.</p>

            <p>There are also other types of memory such as ROM (Read-Only Memory), cache memory, and virtual memory, each serving different purposes in a computer system, and, in their own way, more or less related to RAM itself.</p>
